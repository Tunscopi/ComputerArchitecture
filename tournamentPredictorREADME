# A) Instructions to Compile and Execute tournamentPredictor.cpp
-	l46 (line 46): Enter trace file (to be in same directory as code) here
-	Code prints out final answer X in form â€œMisprediction rate: X%



# B) Alternative Configurations yielding Improvement of prediction
*Results are obtained testing code on large trace file

Default parameters gave misprediction rate of 20.1428% 

1. Misprediction rate: 19.0364%
    Parameters used:
	Using 1 branch for global predictor as opposed to last 2 branches. Hence, a (1,2) correlating predictor for the global predictor produced higher accuracy branch prediction over the (2,2) predictor. with all other default parameters fixed.

Reasoning: It is possible, in the trace program given, there was a strong link between successive branches that was even stronger than the connection between a branch and the previous 2 or more. Hence, the better branch prediction accuracy.


2. Misprediction rate: 15.9399% 
    Parameters used:
	Using an n bit counter of 1 i.e changing predictor (saturating counter after 1 wrong prediction) and changing prediction (in both local & global predictors after 1 wrong prediction) with all other default parameters fixed.

Reasoning:
